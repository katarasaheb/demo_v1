            <h2>Canada's Grocery System is Broken</h2>
            <p>Canadian grocery shopping is expensive, inefficient, and monopolized. The Competition Bureau Report reveals disturbing trends in our food supply chain.</p>
            <p>The 2023 Canadian Competition Bureau Report revealed that the grocery sector is dominated by just three companies, limiting consumer choice and keeping prices high.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Monopolized Market:</strong> 3 companies control 75% of the grocery market, keeping prices artificially high and limiting consumer choice.</li>
                <li><strong>Bloated Supply Chains:</strong> Inefficient distribution channels lead to unnecessary costs and significant food waste across the system.</li>
                <li><strong>US Import Dependency:</strong> Heavy reliance on US imports makes Canadian groceries vulnerable to tariffs and supply disruptions.</li>
                <li><strong>Outdated Supermarkets:</strong> Traditional stores have high operational costs that are ultimately passed on to consumers.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Result? Canadian households pay more while grocery giants make record profits.</p>
